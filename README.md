# kryptonite
Kryptonite is a C# monadic combinatory parser based on the ideas expressed in Superpower and Sprache. I'm trying to implement the ideas straight out of Hutton's & Meijer's paper, but the occasional peek at Superpower helps to clarify the ideas expressed in the paper. I was originally introduced to the MPC idea through one of Nicholas Blumhart's presentations shared in the references section.
