Kryptonite is a C# monadic combinatory parser based on the ideas expressed in Superpower and Sprache. I'm trying to implement the ideas straight out of Hutton's & Meijer's paper, but the occational peek at Superpower helps to clarify the ideas expressed in the paper. I was originally introduced to the MPC idea through one of the Nicholas Blumhart's presentations shared in the refrences section.
