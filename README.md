# Kryptonite
Kryptonite is a dotnet monadic combinatory parser based on the ideas expressed in Superpower and Sprache. 
I'm trying to implement the ideas straight out of Hutton's & Meijer's paper, 
but the occasional peek at Superpower helps to clarify the ideas expressed in the paper. 
I was originally introduced to the MPC idea through one of Nicholas Blumhart's presentations shared in the references section.

## Devlog
- 2024 JUL 29 - I was originally building Kryptonite in C#, but now I see it as an opportunity to learn F#, so I'm starting over.
